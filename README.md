# 🇮🇹 Italian Anki Card Generator (Customized for Persian Learners)

This project is a Python-based automation tool to create high-quality Anki flashcards. It is specifically designed to help Persian speakers learn Italian, but it can be easily adapted for any other language.

## 🌍 Language Note (Persian/Farsi)
I am **Persian**, which is why the phonetic pronunciations and translations in the `words.csv` file are written in **Farsi**. 
> **Note to international users:** You can easily adapt this project to your own native language by simply updating the translations and phonetic columns in the `words.csv` file. The core logic remains the same!

## ✨ Features
* **Native Audio:** Automatically generates Italian audio for each word using `gTTS` (Google Text-to-Speech).
* **Persian Phonetics:** Includes phonetic guides in Farsi to help with difficult Italian sounds.
* **Automatic Packaging:** Creates a single `.apkg` file that includes all media and styles.
* **Mobile Optimized:** Clean CSS design for a great experience on **AnkiDroid**.

## 🛠️ Requirements

Install the necessary Python libraries:

```bash
pip install genanki gtts

```

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Prepare the CSV:** Ensure your `words.csv` file follows this structure (4 columns):
* `Word (Italian)`
* `Phonetic (In my case, Farsi)`
* `Translation`
* `Example Sentence`


2. **Run the Generator:**
```bash
python main.py

```


3. **Import to Anki:**
* Transfer `Italian_With_Audio.apkg` to your mobile or PC.
* Open Anki and click **Import**.
